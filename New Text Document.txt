# 📱 Phone Screen Damage Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple AI-based phone screen damage detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
It classifies images into:
- Damaged
- Not Damaged

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pillow

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## 📈 Current Status
Prototype model trained on small dataset.
Further improvements planned:
- Larger dataset
- Transfer learning (MobileNetV2)
- Accuracy optimization

## 🎯 Objective
To build an AI-powered system that can automatically detect physical screen damage from uploaded images.
